abstract = {Boosting algorithms have been proved effective for multi-label learning. As ensemble learning algorithms, boosting algorithms build classifiers by composing a set of weak hypotheses. The high computational cost of boosting algorithms in learning from large volumes of data such as text categorization datasets is a real challenge. Most boosting algorithms, such as AdaBoost.MH, iteratively examine all training features to generate the weak hypotheses, which increases the learning time. RFBoost was introduced to manage this problem based on a rank-and-filter strategy in which it first ranks the training features and then, in each learning iteration, filters and uses only a subset of the highest-ranked features to construct the weak hypotheses. This step ensures accelerated learning time for RFBoost compared to AdaBoost.MH, as the weak hypotheses produced in each iteration are reduced to a very small number. As feature ranking is the core idea of RFBoost, this paper presents and investigates seven feature ranking methods (information gain, chi-square, GSS-coefficient, mutual information, odds ratio, F1 score, and accuracy) in order to improve RFBoost's performance. Moreover, an accelerated version of RFBoost, called RFBoost1, is also introduced. Rather than filtering a subset of the highest-ranked features, FBoost1 selects only one feature, based on its weight, to build a new weak hypothesis. Experimental results on four benchmark datasets for multi-label text categorization) Reuters-21578, 20-Newsgroups, OHSUMED, and TMC2007(demonstrate that among the methods evaluated for feature ranking, mutual information yields the best performance for RFBoost. In addition, the results prove that RFBoost statistically outperforms both RFBoost1 and AdaBoost.MH on all datasets. Finally, RFBoost1 proved more efficient than AdaBoost.MH, making it a better alternative for addressing classification problems in real-life applications and expert systems.},

In line with the Computers Are Social Actors (CASA) paradigm (Reeves {\&} Nass, 1996), findings suggest that Twitterbots are perceived as credible, attractive, competent in communication, and interactional. Additionally, there were no differences in the perceptions of source credibility, communication competence, or interactional intentions between the bot and human Twitter agents. However, the source of the human Twitter agent was rated higher in attraction (social and task) than was the Twitterbot. Results are discussed in light of CASA.

abstract = {In this volume concerning the natural environment, people, and the relationship between them, Rachel and Stephen Kaplan offer the first research-based analysis of the vital psychological role that nature plays in our lives. Over a period of twenty years, the authors have sought to understand how people perceive nature and what types of natural environments they prefer, what psychological benefits they seem to derive from wilderness experiences, and why backyard gardens are especially important to some people. The book examines the satisfactions and advantages that various natural settings bring to us. While many readers may have little doubt that the natural environment makes a difference to them, they may be suprised to discover the pervasiveness of its impact on people of diverse ages and cultural heritages. Beyond the awe-inspiring mountains and waterfalls, many comparatively simple natural settings foster tranquility and well-being. The book explores questions such as: Is the effect of nature on people as powerful as it intuitively seems to be? What makes natural settings so compelling? How do settings restore bodily health? Are some natural patterns more effective than others? Are there ways to design, manage, and interpret natural environments so as to enhance their beneficial influences? A wide audience will find this analysis of our natural environment compelling and insightful.},

Our proposed model is then applied on three different text mining algorithms and we found the Linear Support vector machine (LSVM) is the most appropriate to work with our proposed model.

Implementation and enforcement of regulations designed to address these impairments can be costly, raising questions about the value of the public benefits derived from improved surface water quality. Here, we assess the recreational value of changes in water quality using freely available geotagged photographs, taken by members of the public, as a proxy for recreational visits to lakes. We found that improved water clarity is associated with increased numbers of visits to lakes and that lake users were willing to incur greater costs to visit clearer lakes. Lake users were willing to travel 56 minutes farther (equivalent to US{\$}22 in travel costs) for every one-meter increase in water clarity in Minnesota and Iowa lakes, when controlling for other lake attributes. Our approach demonstrates the potential for social-media data to inform social–ecological research, including assessment of ...},

abstract = {Cultural ecosystem services, such as aesthetic and recreational enjoyment, as well as sense of place and local identity, play an outstanding role in the contribution of landscapes to human well-being. Online data shared on social networks, particularly geo-tagged photos, are becoming an increasingly attractive source of information about cultural ecosystem services. Landscape photographs tell about the significance of human relationships with landscapes, human practices in landscapes and the landscape features that might possess value in terms of cultural ecosystem services. Despite all the recent advances in this emerging methodological approach, some challenges remain to be explored: (a) how to assess a broad suite of cultural ecosystem services, beyond aesthetic beauty of landscapes, (b) how to identify the landscape features that are relevant for providing cultural ecosystem services and determine trade-offs and synergies among cultural ecosystem services. To address these challenges, we have developed a methodological approach suitable for eliciting the importance of cultural ecosystem services and the landscape features underpinning their provision across five different sites in Europe (in Estonia, Greece, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland). We have performed a content analysis of 1.404 photos uploaded in Flickr and Panoramio platforms that can represent cultural ecosystem services. Four bundles of landscapes features and cultural ecosystem services showed the relation of recreation with mountain areas (terrestrial recreation) and with water bodies (aquatic recreation). Cultural heritage, social and spiritual values were particularly attached to landscapes with woodpastures and grasslands, as well as urban features and infrastructures, i.e. to more anthropogenic landscapes. A positive though weak relationship was found between landscape diversity and cultural ecosystem services diversity. Particularly wood-pastures and shrubs were more frequently portrayed in all study sites in comparison with their actual land cover. The results can be of interest both for methodological purposes in the face of an increasing trend in the use of geo-tagged photos in the ecosystem services research and for the elicitation and comparison of landscape values across European cultural landscapes.},

In this study, the preferences revealed by photo-sharing social media users are analyzed through travel cost modeling to infer the monetary value of recreation in 115 man-made wetland ecosystems. Photographs' metadata and other publicly available information are used to determine the frequency of recreational trips and the home location of visitors. The mean willingness to pay for access to 115 wetlands is found to range between {\$}5.3 and {\$}374 (2015 international {\$}). The comparison of estimated recreational benefits with the capital, operation and maintenance costs of 74 wetlands reveals that such benefits are considerable and should be taken into account in the design and management of these systems. The approach demonstrates the potential for ecosystem service valuation techniques to incorporate the large amounts of behavioral data available from online resources.},

abstract = {Text classification is of importance in natural language processing, as the massive text information containing huge amounts of value needs to be classified into different categories for further use. In order to better classify text, our paper tries to build a deep learning model which achieves better classification results in Chinese text than those of other researchers' models. After comparing different methods, long short-term memory (LSTM) and convolutional neural network (CNN) methods were selected as deep learning methods to classify Chinese text. LSTM is a special kind of recurrent neural network (RNN), which is capable of processing serialized information through its recurrent structure. By contrast, CNN has shown its ability to extract features from visual imagery. Therefore, two layers of LSTM and one layer of CNN were integrated to our new model: the BLSTM-C model (BLSTM stands for bi-directional long short-term memory while C stands for CNN.) LSTM was responsible for obtaining a sequence output based on past and future contexts, which was then input to the convolutional layer for extracting features. In our experiments, the proposed BLSTM-C model was evaluated in several ways. In the results, the model exhibited remarkable performance in text classification, especially in Chinese texts.},

abstract = {Ecosystem services (ES) is a useful framework for land-use decision making oriented to, ensure human well-being. Outdoor recreation potential, as a cultural ecosystem service, pose, particular challenges to its evaluation and mapping: it depends to a greater extent that other ES on, stakeholder{\'{s}} perception and values, it has lower generalization capacity, the delimitation of, provisioning areas is not straightforward and it should be evaluated at different spatial scales. In this, study, we propose a conceptual framework and method that is intended to cope with these challenges. Our method is based on landscape metrics measured at coarse scale, and campsite density as an, indicator of ecosystem service supply and benefit capture. We applied this method to a case study in, Argentina. We estimated outdoor recreation potential level using a quantile multiple regression, analysis of the 0.9 quantile of campsite density with nine landscape metrics determinants of ecosystem, service supply. We also explored two determinants of benefit capture with a linear stepwise regression, analysis of differences between the predicted recreation potential and actual use. We stratified the, analysis by ecoregion to distinguish the different weight of determinants of ecosystem service supply, and benefit capture. The examined landscape determinants showed differences in their explicative capacity of outdoor, recreation potential across ecoregions, showing that their generalization capacity is limited. For, example, and contrary to our expectations, crop area did not have a negative effect for any of the 15, analyzed ecoregions. In fact, significant correlations are positive for three cases. Forest cover, on the, other hand, had a positive effect only in the Pampas ecoregion, originally dominated by grasslands and, where current forests consist in plantations of exotic trees. Results also showed that, in general, unrealized benefit increases with road and population density. Our method makes a contribution to the study of recreation potential under the framework of ES by, taking into account important aspects that are sometimes overlooked. It considers the differences with, other ecosystem services in terms of the underlying processes that control ecosystem service supply, and benefit capture and it can be applied at a very wide spatial extent, at which approaches with other, methods that are more information demanding is difficult. Yet complementary methods at more, detailed spatial scales would provide additional information for a comprehensive estimation of, outdoor recreation potential. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

Tentative title of the issue: 'Self-reliance in safe drinking water provision in Africa: An appropriate solution' "We shall not defeat any of the infectious diseases that plague the developing world until we have also won the battle for safe drinking water, sanitation, and basic health care" Kofi Annan "Although the science behind is seemingly simple, biochar-based water filters represent the untapped potential frugal technology for universal clean drinking water provision". The author "Yet again, African governments in their individual and collective capacities, engage in their predictable and casual 'Wait-and-see' and 'Let-external donors-fund-it' attitude". Abstract Sub-Saharan Africa has not met the United Nations water-related Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) for safe drinking water. This is a pity given water's crucial role in accomplishing the continent's development goals. It is broadly accepted that Africa faces endemic poverty and pervasive under-development. It is also almost univocally accepted that all these countries lack the human, economic (and institutional) capacities to sustainably develop and manage their water resources. This view is unfortunately believed by some Africans. The question arises why Northern Africans, Europeans, Americans and other are more skilled than Sub-Saharan Africans? This contribution demonstrates that African natives are leading in developing two frugal technologies for safe drinking water, with proven extension capacity to sanitation. If these technologies are developed hand-in-hand, Africa can achieve the Sustainable Development Goal 6 (ensuring availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation) within the remaining 13 years. The first technology used biochar, and the second metallic iron in filtrations systems. Both technologies have demonstrated strong capacity to remove several aqueous pollutants including pathogens (e.g., bacteria, viruses), inorganic chemicals (e.g., arsenic, fluoride, nitrate, uranium) and organics (e.g. pesticides, pharmaceutical drug residues). Both technologies have several merits},

abstract = {The recent emergence of dengue viruses into new susceptible human populations throughout Asia and the Middle East, driven in part by human travel on both local and global scales, represents a significant global health risk, particularly in areas with changing climatic suitability for the mosquito vector. In Pakistan, dengue has been endemic for decades in the southern port city of Karachi, but large epidemics in the northeast have emerged only since 2011. Pakistan is therefore representative of many countries on the verge of countrywide endemic dengue transmission, where prevention, surveillance, and preparedness are key priorities in previously dengue-free regions. We analyze spatially explicit dengue case data from a large outbreak in Pakistan in 2013 and compare the dynamics of the epidemic to an epidemiological model of dengue virus transmission based on climate and mobility data from ∼40 million mobile phone subscribers. We find that mobile phone-based mobility estimates predict the geographic spread and timing of epidemics in both recently epidemic and emerging locations. We combine transmission suitability maps with estimates of seasonal dengue virus importation to generate fine-scale dynamic risk maps with direct application to dengue containment and epidemic preparedness.},

abstract = {Reports of rapid growth in nature-based tourism and recreation add significant weight to the economic case for biodiversity conservation but seem to contradict widely voiced concerns that people are becoming increasingly isolated from nature. This apparent paradox has been highlighted by a recent study showing that on a per capita basis, visits to natural areas in the United States and Japan have declined over the last two decades. These results have been cited as evidence of "a fundamental and pervasive shift away from nature-based recreation"-but how widespread is this phenomenon? We address this question by looking at temporal trends in visitor numbers at 280 protected areas (PAs) from 20 countries. This more geographically representative dataset shows that while PA visitation (whether measured as total or per capita visit numbers) is indeed declining in the United States and Japan, it is generally increasing elsewhere. Total visit numbers are growing in 15 of the 20 countries for which we could get data, with the median national rate of change unrelated to the national rate of population growth but negatively associated with wealth. Reasons for this reversal of growth in the richest countries are difficult to pin down with existing data, but the pattern is mirrored by trends in international tourist arrivals as a whole and so may not necessarily be caused by disaffection with nature. Irrespective of the explanation, it is clear that despite important downturns in some countries, nature-related tourism is far from declining everywhere, and may still have considerable potential both to generate funds for conservation and to shape people's attitudes to the environment.},

abstract = {During the past decade there has been an explosion in computation and information tech-nology. With it have come vast amounts of data in a variety of fields such as medicine, biolo-gy, finance, and marketing. The challenge of understanding these data has led to the devel-opment of new tools in the field of statistics, and spawned new areas such as data mining, machine learning, and bioinformatics. Many of these tools have common underpinnings but are often expressed with different terminology. This book describes the important ideas in these areas in a common conceptual framework. While the approach is statistical, the emphasis is on concepts rather than mathematics. Many examples are given, with a liberal use of color graphics. It should be a valuable resource for statisticians and anyone interested in data mining in science or industry. The book's coverage is broad, from supervised learning (prediction) to unsupervised learning. The many topics include neural networks, support vector machines, classification trees and boosting—the first comprehensive treatment of this topic in any book. This major new edition features many topics not covered in the original, including graphical models, random forests, ensemble methods, least angle regression {\&} path algorithms for the lasso, non-negative matrix factorization, and spectral clustering. There is also a chapter on methods for " wide " data (p bigger than n), including multiple testing and false discovery rates. Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, and Jerome Friedman are professors of statistics at Stanford University. They are prominent researchers in this area: Hastie and Tibshirani developed generalized additive models and wrote a popular book of that title. Hastie co-developed much of the statistical modeling software and environment in R/S-PLUS and invented principal curves and surfaces. Tibshirani proposed the lasso and is co-author of the very successful An Introduction to the Bootstrap. Friedman is the co-inventor of many data-mining tools including CART, MARS, projection pursuit and gradient boosting.},

abstract = {Mining of social media has been shown to be a useful tool for social and biological research (e.g. tracking disease out breaks). This article outlines an accessible approach to the use of text and data mining (TDM) of social media to gather information on wildlife recreation activity. The spatio-temporal distribution of the shore based recreational European seabass (Dicentrarchus labrax) fishery in Wales is used as an example. Public online user generated content was mined using automated scraping. Data on fisher activity and fish sizes were extracted and then georeferenced by matching place names to a custom compiled gazetteer. Numbers of trips and spatio-temporal trends in the distribution of activity and catches were estimated. Prosecution was higher in summer than winter, and gear use and trip durations were consistent during the period 2002–13. Comparisons of TDM with existing surveys showed higher levels of activity and catch, and shorter mean trip durations were estimated using TDM. Monthly activity correlated closely with existing survey data. Spatial and temporal data agreed qualitatively with expert knowledge. This article showed that TDM can be used to describe a wildlife recreation activity, but use of TDM to derive unbiased population level estimates is challenging and more work is required to develop appropriate methods to correct for bias. These methods required no expertise in natural language processing or machine learning, a working knowledge of programming (e.g. in Python or R) is all that is needed to apply this approach. The opportunities to use TDM will increase with the continuing adoption of smartphones in emerging economies and developing nations and is of may be of particular utility where other data is unavailable.},

abstract = {Research on tourist mobility in combination with the tourists' experiences has been rare to date. Previous studies focusing on the activities of tourists in time and space have most often used the method of time–space diaries. However, an important flaw in this method is that these recordings depend on the respondents' personal observations and notes. This disadvantage is avoided by using Global Positioning Systems (GPS) devices, which record their carriers' movements directly, thus replacing personal notes. This new method was used to study the time–space movements of visitors during the Biathlon World Championships 2008 in {\"{O}}stersund, Sweden. In addition to the GPS devices, questionnaires were used to study the tourists' movements and experiences. In trying to combine methods to support the event analysis, the aim of the study is to evaluate the practicability of GPS devices during an outdoor sports event. Movements and experiences in time and space are studied. In order to answer questions regarding the visitors' movements on a macro-level, these methods were combined with bird's-eye view photographs taken of the race arena every minute. The overall results of this study thereby contribute to our understanding of time–space movements. The questionnaires offer comprehensive background information about the participants and their experiences, although some modifications will have to be made in future studies. The information provided by the photographs substantially complements the itineraries collected by means of GPS.},

abstract = {—In this paper we study the problem of building doc-ument classifiers using labeled features and unlabeled documents, where not all the features are helpful for the process of learning. This is an important setting, since building classifiers using labeled words has been recently shown to require considerably less human labeling effort than building classifiers using labeled documents. We propose the use of Generalized Expectation (GE) criteria combined with a L1 regularization term for learning from labeled features. This lets the feature labels guide model expectation constraints, while approaching feature selection from a regularization perspective. We show that GE criteria combined with L1 regularization consistently outperforms – up to 12{\%} increase in accuracy – the best previously reported results in the literature under the same setting, obtained using L2 regulariza-tion. Furthermore, the results obtained with GE criteria and L1 regularizer are competitive to those obtained in the traditional instance-labeling setting, with the same labeling cost.},

abstract = {Citizens are increasingly becoming an important source of geographic information, sometimes entering domains that had until recently been the exclusive realm of authoritative agencies. This activity has a very diverse character as it can, amongst other things, be active or passive, involve spatial or aspatial data and the data provided can be variable in terms of key attributes such as format, description and quality. Unsurprisingly, therefore, there are a variety of terms used to describe data arising from citizens. In this article, the expressions used to describe citizen sensing of geographic information are reviewed and their use over time explored, prior to categorizing them and highlighting key issues in the current state of the subject. The latter involved a review of {\{}$\backslash$textasciitilde{\}}100 Internet sites with particular focus on their thematic topic, the nature of the data and issues such as incentives for contributors. This review suggests that most sites involve active rather than passive contribution, with citizens typically motivated by the desire to aid a worthy cause, often receiving little training. As such, this article provides a snapshot of the role of citizens in crowdsourcing geographic information and a guide to the current status of this rapidly emerging and evolving subject.},

abstract = {On March 23, 1989, the Exxon Valdez ran aground in Alaska's Prince William Sound and released over 250,000 barrels of crude oil, resulting in 1,300 miles of oiled shoreline. The Exxon spill ignited a debate about the appropriate compensation for damages suffered, and among economists, a debate concerning the adequacy of methods to value public goods, particularly when the good in question has limited direct use, such as the pristine natural environment of the spill region. The efficacy of stated preference methods generally, and contingent valuation in particular, is no mere academic debate. Billions of dollars are at stake. An influential symposium appearing in this journal in 1994 provided arguments for and against the credibility of these methods, and an extensive research program published in academic journals has continued to this day. This paper assesses what occurred in this academic literature between the Exxon spill and the BP disaster. We will rely on theoretical developments, neoclassical and behavioral paradigms, empirical and experimental evidence, and a clearer elucidation of validity criteria to provide a framework for readers to ponder the question of the validity of contingent valuation and, more generally, stated preference methods.},

The services used by today's knowledge workers prepare the ground for sophisticated social engineering attacks. The growing trend towards BYOD (bring your own device) policies and the use of online communication and collaboration tools in private and business environments aggravate the problem. In globally acting companies, teams are no longer geographically co-located, but staffed just-in-time. The decrease in personal interaction combined with a plethora of tools used for communication (e-mail, IM, Skype, Dropbox, LinkedIn, Lync, etc.) create new attack vectors for social engineering attacks. Recent attacks on companies such as the New York Times and RSA have shown that targeted spear-phishing attacks are an effective, evolutionary step of social engineering attacks. Combined with zero-day-exploits, they become a dangerous weapon that is often used by advanced persistent threats. This paper provides a taxonomy of well-known social engineering attacks as well as a comprehensive overview of advanced social engineering attacks on the knowledge worker.},

abstract = {Understanding the relationship between the number of visits to national parks and their characteristics is crucial for park planning and management. Visitation has a key role in existing national parks, but also in assessing the social and economic impacts of new parks. This study examined how the natural characteristics of a park, the recreation facilities and services inside a park and tourist services in surrounding communities, as well as the park's location in relation to the population, are associated with the number of visits. Regression modelling was used to analyse the visitation to thirty-five national parks in Finland. The results demonstrated that recreation opportunities, the number of biotopes, the provision of trails and the park's age increase the number of visits, while the park location in relation to the population only has a significant effect in southern Finland. The results imply the dual role of national parks as resource-based destinations if the natural characteristics are outstanding, but also as more user-oriented areas fulfilling recreation needs in the most populated parts of the country. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier GmbH.

Based on that, we identify the differ- ent types of active users on Instagram using clustering. Our results reveal several insights about Instagram which were never studied before, that include: 1) Eight popular photos categories, 2) Five distinct types of Instagram users in terms of their posted photos, and 3) A user's audience (number of followers) is independent of his/her shared photos on Insta- gram.

abstract = {ABSTRACTHow do people perceive landscapes? What elements of the landscape do they identify as characteristic of a landscape? And how can we arrive at descriptions, and ultimately representations that better reflect people?s notions of landscapes? In this study, we collected landscape descriptions from five landscape types at 10 study sites in Switzerland. For each site, we collected data from three sources: free lists with participants, hiking blogs, and Flickr tags. Free lists were obtained through on-site interviews with visitors, hiking blogs were gathered by focused crawling of web content, and Flickr tags were selected based on spatial footprints obtained from the hiking blogs. We quantitatively compared landscape descriptions between data sources and landscape types using cosine similarity. We found that descriptions from the same data source were significantly more similar, irrespective of landscape type. Descriptions from the same landscape type were more similar, but only within the same data source. Through a qualitative analysis of different aspects of landscape in our content, we found that each data source offered a different distribution of landscape aspects. For example, while Flickr tags contained high proportions of toponyms, they contained little content relating to sense of place. In contrast, hiking blogs contained more information about sense of place. Our approach combining these varied textual sources thus offers a more holistic view on landscapes. This study constitutes a step toward extracting semantically rich descriptions of landscapes from a variety of sources and using this information to distinguish different landscapes, with potential applications for landscape monitoring and management.},

abstract = {The analysis of spatial autocorrelation is a fundamental tool for the understanding of all the physical as well as anthropological processes which naturally take place within the geographical space, and which cannot be studied independently from it. The deployment of statistical techniques for investigating spatial autocorrelation has brought valuable results within manifold research fields ranging from the natural sciences to the socio-economic sciences. Moreover, the affinity between cartography and this kind of analysis has raised particular interest among GIS users as well as developers. This has led to the inclusion of many modules dedicated to the spatial autocorrelation mapping within both proprietary GIS software suites as well as free and open source programming libraries. Nevertheless, specific functionalities for spatial autocorrelation mapping have not yet been formally included-through dedicated user interfaces-within the most popular free and open source GIS software, such as QGIS. We present here the Hotspot Analysis Plugin, an experimental QGIS plugin-dedicated to the spatial autocorrelation mapping-based on the free and open source Python library PySAL (Python Spatial Analysis Library). Together with the technical specifications, two relevant examples of the plugin usage-connected to real case studies- A re reported. These are: The detection of significant variations in soil consumption for the Lombardy Region (northern Italy) and the spatial correlation analysis of performance indicators characterizing Airbnb(tm) lodgings for the city of Venice (Italy).},

abstract = {Individuals, communities, and societies ascribe a diverse array of values to landscapes. These values are shaped by the aesthetic, cultural, and recreational benefits and services provided by those landscapes. However, across the globe, processes such as urbanization, agricultural intensification, and abandonment are threatening landscape integrity, altering the personally meaningful connections people have toward specific places. Existing methods used to study landscape values, such as social surveys, are poorly suited to capture dynamic landscape-scale processes across large geographic extents. Social media data, by comparison, can be used to indirectly measure and identify valuable features of landscapes at a regional, continental, and perhaps even worldwide scale. We evaluate the usefulness of different social media platforms-Panoramio, Flickr, and Instagram-and quantify landscape values at a continental scale. We find Panoramio, Flickr, and Instagram data can be used to quantify landscape values, with features of Instagram being especially suitable due to its relatively large population of users and its functional ability of allowing users to attach personally meaningful comments and hashtags to their uploaded images. Although Panoramio, Flickr, and Instagram have different user profiles, our analysis revealed similar patterns of landscape values across Europe across the three platforms. We also found variables describing accessibility, population density, income, mountainous terrain, or proximity to water explained a significant portion of observed variation across data from the different platforms. Social media data can be used to extend our understanding of how and where individuals ascribe value to landscapes across diverse social, political, and ecological boundaries.},

abstract = {Understanding user experience (UX) becomes more important in a market-driven design paradigm because it helps designers uncover significant factors, such as user's preference, usage context, product features, as well as their interrelations. Conventional means, such as questionnaire, survey and self-report with predefined questions and prompts, are used to collect information about users' experience during various UX studies. However, such data is often limited and restricted by initial setups, and they won't easily allow designers to identify all critical elements such as user profile, context, related product features, etc. Meanwhile, with widely accessible social media, the volume and velocity of customer-generated data are fast-increasing. While it is generally acknowledged that such data contains important elements in understanding and analyzing UX, extracting them to assist product design remains a challenging issue. In this study, how UX data underlying product design can be isolated and restored from customer online reviews is examined. A faceted conceptual model is proposed to elucidate the crucial factors of UX, which serves as an operational mechanism connecting to product design. A methodology of establishing a UX knowledge base from customer online reviews is then proposed to support UX-centered design activities, which consists of three stages, i.e., UX discovery to extract UX data from a single review, UX data integration to group similar data and UX network formalization to build up the causal dependencies among UX groups. Using a case study on smart mobile phone reviews, examples of UX data discovered are demonstrated and both customers and designers concerned key product features and usage situations are exemplified. This study explores the feasibility to discover valuable UX data as well as their relations automatically for product design and business strategic plan by analyzing a large volume of customer online data.},

abstract = {Conservation prioritization at large scales is complex, combining biological, environmental and social factors. While conservation scientists now more often aim to incorporate human-related factors, a critical yet unquantified challenge remains - to identify which areas people actually use for recreation outside urban centers. To address this gap in applied ecology and conservation, we developed a novel approach for quantifying human presence beyond populated areas by combining social media "big data" and remote sensing. We used data from the Flickr photo-sharing website as a surrogate for identifying spatial variation in visitation globally, and complemented this estimate with spatially explicit information on stable night lights between the years 2004-2012, used as a proxy for identifying urban and industrial centers. Natural and semi-natural areas attracting visitors were defined as both highly photographed and non-lit areas. The number of Flickr photographers within protected areas was found to be a reliable surrogate for estimating visitor numbers as confirmed by local authority counts (r=0.8). Half of all visitors' photos taken in protected areas originated from under 1{\%} of all protected areas on Earth (250 of {\~{}}27,000). The most photographed protected areas globally included Yosemite and Yellowstone National Parks, and UK's Lake and Peak Districts. Factors explaining the spatial variation in Flickr protected areas coverage included their type (e.g., UNESCO World Heritage sites have higher visitation) and accessibility to roads and trails. Using this approach, we identified photography hotspots, which draw many visitors and are unlit (i.e. are located outside urban centers), but currently remain largely unprotected, such as Brazil's Pantanal and Bolivia's Salar de Uyuni. The integrated "big data" approach developed here demonstrates the benefits of combining remote sensing sources and novel geo-tagged and crowd-sourced information from social media in future efforts to identify spatial conservation gaps and pressures globally in real time, and their spatial and temporal variation.},

These data, especially geotagged ones, contain information about perception of and experiences in various environments. Harnessing these data can be used to provide a better understanding of the semantics of places. We are interested in the similarities or differences between different Geo-Social Media in the description of places. This extended abstract presents the results of a first step towards a more in-depth study of semantic similarity of places. Particularly, we took places extracted through spatio-temporal clustering from one data source (Twitter) and examined whether their structure is reflected semantically in another data set (Flickr). Based on that, we analyse how the semantic similarity between places varies over space and scale, and how Tobler's first law of geography holds with regards to scale and places.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Further progress towards understanding compositionality in tasks such as sentiment detection requires richer supervised training and evaluation resources and more powerful models of composition. To remedy this, we introduce a Sentiment Treebank. It includes fine grained sentiment labels for 215,154 phrases in the parse trees of 11,855 sentences and presents new challenges for sentiment compositionality. To address them, we introduce the Recursive Neural Tensor Network. When trained on the new treebank, this model outperforms all previous methods on several metrics. It pushes the state of the art in single sentence positive/negative classification from 80{\%} up to 85.4{\%}. The accuracy of predicting fine-grained sentiment labels for all phrases reaches 80.7{\%}, an improvement of 9.7{\%} over bag of features baselines. Lastly, it is the only model that can accurately capture the effects of negation and its scope at various tree levels for both positive and negative phrases.},

abstract = {In a Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA) or an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA), determining the value that the general public attaches to a landscape is often problematic. To aid the inclusion of this social value in such analyses, a Google Maps-based tool, called the HotSpotMonitor (HSM), was developed. The HSM determines which natural places are highly attractive by having people mark such places on a map. The definition of attractiveness remains open to avoid having marker placement being influenced by preconceived thoughts. The number of markers an area receives is considered to indicate its social value. Six regions were selected, and from these, stratified samples were drawn (total n=3293). Participants placed markers at three spatial levels: local, regional and national. This paper focuses on the markers at the national level. The first research question is whether the HSM can produce an accurate map of highly attractive places at a national level. The results indicated that while in principle HSM can produce such a map, the spatial representativeness of the sample is important. The region of origin of the participants influenced where they placed their markers, an effect previously termed spatial discounting. The second research question considers which qualities the participants associate with the marked places. These qualities were very similar at all three spatial levels: green, natural, presence of water and quiet were often selected out of the fourteen suggested qualities. The third, and more exploratory, research question concerns which characteristics of an area predict its attractiveness. Natural and forest areas had higher marker densities than water surfaces or all other types of land use combined. The discussion evaluates the potential of the HSM to generate input on social landscape values for CBAs and EIAs. {\textcopyright} 2013.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: We aimed to determine whether there was a difference in post-operative symptomatic control and quality of life (QoL) between patients who were obese (BMI {\textgreater}30) and non-obese (BMI {\textless}30) pre-operatively. This information may inform the decision making of Physicians and patients whether to proceed to surgery for management of symptomatic lumbar disc prolapse. METHODS: We conducted a prospective questionnaire-based study of QoL and symptom control in 120 patients with postal follow-up at 3 and 12 months after lumbar disc surgery. This study was conducted in two United Kingdom regional neurosurgical units, with ethical approval from the North of Scotland Research Ethics Service (09/S0801/7). RESULTS: 120 patients were recruited; 37 (34.5{\%}) were obese. Follow up was 71{\%} at 3 months and 57{\%} at 12 months. At recruitment, both obese and non-obese patient groups had similar functional status and pain scores. At 3 and 12 months, non-obese and obese patients reported similar and significant benefits from surgery (e.g. 12 month SF-36 80.5 vs. 68.8, respectively). In non-obese and obese patients, time to return to work was 47.5 days and 53.8 days, respectively, (p = .345). After 12 months all QoL scores were significantly improved from pre-operative levels in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: Obese patients derive significant benefit from lumbar discectomy that it is similar to the benefit experienced by non-obese patients. Obese individuals may achieve excellent results from discectomy and these patients should not be refused surgery on the basis of BMI alone.},

Making a distinction between the medium itself (social networking platform) and how it is used by users, we set the research question of how possible is a malicious user to retrieve personal data in an automated undetectable way and use them against an unsuspicious person that uses social media. Answering the above question, this paper had intended to detect the possibility of retrieving information in an automated way of two popular social networks, Twitter and Instagram, without the consent or informing the end user - target. The results shown that our activity on social networks, can be exploited by a malicious user using Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) techniques and can collect sensitive personal data (user location via tweets / instas from smartphone). This work showcases user activity (geolocated tweets, instas) on a Google Map and connects this activity in chronological order with vectors, using a travel by map animation. Points of interest are clustered. Showed that users of twitter and instagram cannot fully protected from intruders and misusage of personal information, which unhappily keeps to propagate the personality of the medium. It is worth mentioning that the location activity took place in the two particular social networks, through the targeted user smartphone, reveals the GPS coordinates of the user activity and this was reproduced in a Google Maps type map where we also placed connecting points chronologically. This way a malicious user can track a person?s activity and it is possible to predict future location.},

abstract = {Quantifying and mapping cultural ecosystem services is complex because of their intangibility. Data from social media, such as geo-tagged photographs, have been proposed for mapping cultural use or appreciation of ecosystems. However, manual content analysis and classification of large numbers of photographs is time consuming. This study develops a novel method for automating content analysis of social media photographs for ecosystem services assessment. The approach applies an online machine learning algorithm – Google Cloud Vision – to analyse over 20,000 photographs from Singapore, and uses hierarchical clustering to group these photographs. The accuracy of the classification was assessed by comparison with manual classification. Over 20{\%} of photographs were taken of nature, being of animals or plants. The distribution of nature photographs was concentrated around particular natural attractions, and nature photographs were more likely to occur in parks and areas of high vegetation cover. The approach developed for clustering photographs was accurate and saved approximately 170 h of manual work. The method provides an indicator of cultural ecosystem services that can be applied rapidly over large areas. Automated assessment and mapping of cultural ecosystem services could be used to inform urban planning.},

The massive-scale experiment manipulated the News Feeds of a large amount of Facebook users and was successful in proving that emotional contagion happens also in online environments. However, the experiment caused ethical concerns within and outside academia mainly for two intertwined reasons, the first revolving around the idea of research as manipulation, and the second focusing on the problematic definition of informed consent. The article concurs with recent research that the era of social media and big data research are posing a significant challenge to research ethics, the practice and views of which are grounded in the pre social media era, and reflect the classical ethical stances of utilitarianism and deontology.},

abstract = {There are abundant anecdotes and warnings of inappropriate behaviors on social networking sites, particularly about Facebook. The purpose of the present study was to examine whether individuals obsessively monitor or harass their ex-partners on Facebook (related to general 'Facebook stalking') and, if so, whether those individuals would also engage in cyber obsessional pursuit (COP) and obsessive relational pursuit (ORI), which are categories of cyberstalking and stalking. A total of 411 valid participants answered questions about the ways they communicated with their ex-romantic partners using Facebook, resulting in three factors: Covert Provocation, Public Harassment, and Venting. Each category of Facebook harassment was related to perpetration of COP and ORI. Additionally, participants who engaged in COP were almost six times more likely to also perpetrate ORI. If participants admitted to engaging in some types of stalking behaviors, they did so online, offline, and on Facebook. Implications for social networking site usage and stalking laws are discussed. There is a kernel of truth to the popular term 'Facebook stalking.' [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

abstract = {Traditional approaches for evaluating aesthetic value rely on surveys or interviews. Social media provides a new type of crowdsourcing data to examine the relationships between aesthetic value and citizens' activities. The main goal of this paper was to evaluate aesthetic value in Nebraska by using citizen-reported geo-tagged photographs posted on two social media sites Panoramio and Flickr. The study used the application programming interface from Panoramio and Flickr to obtain the latitude and longitude of the geo-tagged photographs, and then used ArcGIS spatial statistical tools to examine spatial patterns with areas of aesthetic value in Nebraska. The outcomes identified the clusters of pictures with the locations of ecosystem service provisioning areas of aesthetic value in Nebraska, identified new areas with aesthetic value, and drew comparisons with local and regional population distribution. This study provided an innovative approach to using crowdsourcing data to verify the value of ecosystem services.},

abstract = {Cultural ecosystem services (CES) are an important benefit that habitats provide, particularly in the fragments of natural ecosystems that remain in urban areas. To manage CES we need to understand what people use habitats for, and where different activities take place. It is challenging to assess CES provision, as surveys and interviews are time consuming and can be expensive. Social media data, particularly geo-tagged photographs, are spatially explicit and contain visual information that can be used to infer cultural use. Indicators of CES derived from social media make use of existing data so may contribute useful information for rapid, cost-effective assessments of CES. In this study we develop an indicator of CES usage that is derived from photographs from an image-sharing website, at two different scales. First, we compare four small ({\textless}150 ha) urban mangrove sites in Singapore, using photograph content to classify sites according to predominant cultural use. Second, the spatial distribution of different CES was modelled within one site using MaxEnt. A resampling simulation was conducted to identify the sensitivity of the photograph classification to the number of photographs classified. Photographs of social recreation, organisms and landscapes occurred most commonly. The proportional occurrence of photograph types differed between sites depending on their characteristics. Within one site, the probability of occurrence of social recreation photographs was highest around built focal points, while photographs of organisms were more likely in the mangrove and terrestrial habitats. Classifying more than 50-70 photographs (which would take approximately 30 minutes) gave only small increases in categorisation accuracy. This tool for CES assessment rapidly provided information that would be useful for managing Singapore's mangroves. The approach could be widely applied to assess CES provision across a range of habitats and settings, helping CES to become more commonly considered in ecosystem service evaluations.},

Guidelines referring to social media were classified according to published typologies of social media research uses and ethical considerations for social media mining. Using health research as an exemplar, PubMed was searched to identify studies using social media data, which were assessed according to their coverage of ethical considerations and guidelines.},

abstract = {Protected area management and marketing require real-time information on visitors' behavior and preferences. Thus far, visitor information has been collected mostly with repeated visitor surveys. A wealth of content-rich geographic data is produced by users of different social media platforms. These data could potentially provide continuous information about people's activities and interactions with the environment at different spatial and temporal scales. In this paper, we compare social media data with traditional survey data in order to map people's activities and preferences using the most popular national park in Finland, Pallas-Yll{\"{a}}stunturi National Park, as a case study. We compare systematically collected survey data and the content of geotagged social media data and analyze: (i) where do people go within the park; (ii) what are their activities; (iii) when do people visit the park and if there are temporal patterns in their activities; (iv) who the visitors are; (v) why people visit the national park; and (vi) what complementary information from social media can provide in addition to the results from traditional surveys. The comparison of survey and social media data demonstrated that geotagged social media content provides relevant information about visitors' use of the national park. As social media platforms are a dynamic source of data, they could complement and enrich traditional forms of visitor monitoring by providing more insight on emerging activities, temporal patterns of shared content, and mobility patterns of visitors. Potentially, geotagged social media data could also provide an overview of the spatio-temporal activity patterns in other areas where systematic visitor monitoring is not taking place.},

abstract = {Explored the important reasons individuals attach to leisure as a means of coping with work stress. The sample was made up of 695 principals and deputy principals from secondary schools throughout New Zealand. Analysis revealed that there were two reasons why leisure is important as a means of coping; one because of its active/challenging nature and the other because of its more passive or recuperative nature. The items that made up these two broad categories were then further explored in relation to a number of measures of well-being. This involved the use of sequential tree analysis and the sequential unfolding of the different reasons. The pattern to emerge suggested that 'being totally focused' was an important reason for engaging in active/challenging leisure whereas a more complex profile emerged for using passive or recuperative leisure activities. The significance of these findings is discussed in terms of intervention strategies and the role of leisure within work stress research. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2007 APA, all rights reserved)},

abstract = {Outdoor recreation is one of many important benefits provided by public lands. Data on recreational use are critical for informing management of recreation resources, however, managers often lack actionable information on visitor use for large protected areas that lack controlled access points. The purpose of this study is to explore the potential for social media data (e.g., geotagged images shared on Flickr and trip reports shared on a hiking forum) to provide land managers with useful measures of recreational use to dispersed areas, and to provide lessons learned from comparing several more traditional counting methods. First, we measure daily and monthly visitation rates to individual trails within the Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest (MBSNF) in western Washington. At 15 trailheads, we compare counts of hikers from infrared sensors, timelapse cameras, and manual on-site counts, to counts based on the number of shared geotagged images and trip reports from those locations. Second, we measure visitation rates to each National Forest System (NFS) unit across the US and compare annual measurements derived from the number of geotagged images to estimates from the US Forest Service National Visitor Use Monitoring Program. At both the NFS unit and the individual-trail scales, we found strong correlations between traditional measures of recreational use and measures based on user-generated content shared on the internet. For national forests in every region of the country, correlations between official Forest Service statistics and geotagged images ranged between 55{\%} and 95{\%}. For individual trails within the MBSNF, monthly visitor counts from on-site measurements were strongly correlated with counts from geotagged images (79{\%}) and trip reports (91{\%}). The convenient, cost-efficient and timely nature of collecting and analyzing user-generated data could allow land managers to monitor use over different seasons of the year and at sites and scales never previously monitored, contributing to a more comprehensive understanding of recreational use patterns and values.},

abstract = {Terms used to describe city centers, such as Downtown, are key concepts in everyday or vernacular language. Here, we explore such language by harvesting georeferenced and tagged metadata associated with 8 million Flickr images and thus consider how large numbers of people name city core areas. The nature of errors and imprecision in tagging and georeferencing are quantified, and automatically generated precision measures appear to mirror errors in the positioning of images. Users seek to ascribe appropriate semantics to images, though bulk-uploading and bulk-tagging may introduce bias. Between 0.5--2{\%} of tags associated with georeferenced images analyzed describe city core areas generically, while 70{\%} of all georeferenced images analyzed include specific place name tags, with place names at the granularity of city names being by far the most common. Using Flickr metadata, it is possible not only to describe the use of the term Downtown across the USA, but also to explore the borders of city center neighborhoods at the level of individual cities, whilst accounting for bias by the use of tag profiles.},

In the qualitative stage, a novel approach integrating collaborative geographic information system (GIS) techniques and informal interviews generated complementary insights about the spatial and non-spatial factors influencing attitude towards urban green spaces. Affinity analysis aggregated the issues into three homogeneous categories that guided the construction of questionnaire items. A self-administered mail-back questionnaire was developed and distributed to 322 households using a multistage cluster sampling strategy; 179 questionnaires were returned (55.6{\%}). In the quantitative phase, factor analysis and reliability analysis were applied to the items set to create a valid attitude measurement scale. The analysis shows that households are characterized by a two-factor attitude structure towards urban green spaces: behavior and usefulness. It is concluded that urban green spaces attitude is a multi-dimensional construct. The implications for green spaces planning are outlined. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Forests and woodlands have long been associated with tourism and recreation and there is a growing demand for improved planning tools to measure and maximize amenity value from policy intervention. Building on earlier studies, this study develops a trip generation function (TGF) to predict visit rates to public and privately owned forest sites in Great Britain. Using a zonal approach, the models were based on visit counts to 100 countryside woodland sites. A survey of forest managers was made to collect data on facilities and characteristics, and geographical information systems analysis was used to define outset zones and compile data on the population living within the zones and the quality and accessibility of alternative woodlands. A series of stand-alone TGFs were developed. In addition to size of population living within a 2-h travel time and substitute-site accessibility, the results highlighted the importance of the number of site facilities in determining visit rates. The results of a cross-validation suggest that the TGFs are sufficiently robust to predict visitor numbers at an aggregate level. However, the current value of this type of modelling to forest management decision making, and further advancement in modelling to allow transferability of results to unsurveyed sites is currently constrained by a number of data limitations, including the quality of available visit data},

abstract = {We proposed a mapping method for landscape aesthetic demand and potential supply area based on viewsheds, which is a direct method that provides robust results. Moreover, we mapped the aesthetic value of Hokkaido as a case study in Asia. The Aichi Biodiversity Target refers to the importance of ecosystem service (ES) mapping methodologies. However, ES mapping in policy and practice has rarely been reported. Robust, reliable indicators are required. Recently, studies estimating aesthetic value have used geotagged photos on social networking services instead of survey results of user preferences. The methods used in these studies were cost effective and provided spatially explicit results. However, these methods used the photography positions. Using the photographed sites is a more direct method to estimate the aesthetic demand. Therefore, we used geotagged photos on Flickr and viewsheds from each photography position to identify the photographed sites. The demand area was estimated using the viewshed. The potential supply area was estimated using MaxEnt. The demand and potential supply areas were concentrated in natural parks. Comparing the demand and potential supply areas indicates areas with potential supply despite their low demand in forest, farmland, and natural parks. This method will contribute to CES research and decision-making.},

In fact, in a dataset where the location of an individual is specified hourly, and with a spatial resolution equal to that given by the carrier's antennas, four spatio-temporal points are enough to uniquely identify 95{\%} of the individuals. We coarsen the data spatially and temporally to find a formula for the uniqueness of human mobility traces given their resolution and the available outside information. This formula shows that the uniqueness of mobility traces decays approximately as the 1/10 power of their resolution. Hence, even coarse datasets provide little anonymity. These findings represent fundamental constraints to an individual's privacy and have important implications for the design of frameworks and institutions dedicated to protect the privacy of individuals.},

abstract = {Social media data is increasingly used as a proxy for human activity in different environments, including protected areas, where collecting visitor information is often laborious and expensive, but important for management and marketing. Here, we compared data from Instagram, Twitter and Flickr, and assessed systematically how park popularity and temporal visitor counts derived from social media data perform against high-precision visitor statistics in 56 national parks in Finland and South Africa in 2014. We show that social media activity is highly associated with park popularity, and social media-based monthly visitation patterns match relatively well with the official visitor counts. However, there were considerable differences between platforms as Instagram clearly outperformed Twitter and Flickr. Furthermore, we show that social media data tend to perform better in more visited parks, and should always be used with caution. Based on stakeholder discussions we identified potential reasons why social media data and visitor statistics might not match: the geography and profile of the park, the visitor profile, and sudden events. Overall the results are encouraging in broader terms: Over 60{\%} of the national parks globally have Twitter or Instagram activity, which could potentially inform global nature conservation.},

This method is expensive and provides limited spatial and temporal coverage. A new source of information is available from online social media websites such as flickr. Here, we test whether this source of "big data" can be used to approximate visitation rates. We use the locations of photographs in flickr to estimate visitation rates at 836 recreational sites around the world, and use information from the profiles of the photographers to derive travelers' origins. We compare these estimates to empirical data at each site and conclude that the crowd-sourced information can indeed serve as a reliable proxy for empirical visitation rates. This new approach offers opportunities to understand which elements of nature attract people to locations around the globe, and whether changes in ecosystems will alter visitation rates.},

We explore the trade-off between accuracy and coverage of this method. Further, we explore differences across content received from multiple platforms and devices, and show, for example, that content shared via different sources and applications produces significantly different geographic distributions, and that it is preferred to model and predict location for items according to their source. Our findings show the potential and the bounds of a data-driven approach to assigning location data to short social media texts, and offer implications for all applications that use data-driven approaches to locate content.},

We used Scotland as a case study to validate the use of data from Flickr as an indicator of NbR on a national scale and at several regional spatial and temporal resolu- tions. We compared Flickr photographs to visitor statistics in the Cairngorms National Park (CNP) and determined whether temporal variability in photo counts could be explained by known annual estimates of CNP visitor numbers. We then used a unique recent national survey of nature recreation in Scotland to determine whether the spatial distribution of Flickr photos could be explained by known spatial variability in nature use. Following this validation work, we used Flickr data to identify hotspots of wildlife watching in Scotland and investigated how they changed between 2005 and 2015. We found that spatial and temporal patterns in Flickr count are explained by measures of visitation obtained through surveys and that this relationship is reliable down to a 10 Km scale reso- lution. Our findings have implications for planning and management of NbR as they sug- gest that photographs uploaded on Flickr reflect patterns of NbR at spatial and temporal scales that are relevant for ecosystem management.},

abstract = {Recent approaches to text classification have used two different first-order probabilistic models for classification , both of which make the naive Bayes assumption. Some use a multi-variate Bernoulli model, that is, a Bayesian Network with no dependencies between words and binary word features (e.g. Larkey and Croft 1996; Koller and Sahami 1997). Others use a multinomial model, that is, a uni-gram language model with integer word counts (e.g. Lewis and Gale 1994; Mitchell 1997). This paper aims to clarify the confusion by describing the differences and details of these two models, and by empirically comparing their classification performance on five text corpora. We find that the multi-variate Bernoulli performs well with small vocabulary sizes, but that the multinomial performs usually performs even better at larger vocabulary sizes-providing on average a 27{\%} reduction in error over the multi-variate Bernoulli model at any vocabulary size.},
