\section{Recorded biases}

\subsection{Interviews}
Who one interviews is strongly dependant on the activity a person performes. A biker or Jogger is much harder to interupt and convince to take part in an interview compared to a casual walker/hiker.

Reasons / motivations to why they came to that specific spot that people mentioned was sometimes influenced by the author who did the interviews by giving some suggestions to which the people mostly agreed 

\subsection{models}

argue if classifications were to specific 

location: could have filtered out locations which refered to the entire research region, similar to \parencite{Heikinheimo2017}

and to little training's data per class!!

- aussagekraft der r√§umlichen Verteilung der Instagram daten aufgrund der allgemeinen Location-tags.


- Explain low representation of horse\_riding trainings-data
- Explain the effect of only training a model on the text-data and leaving out the image labels. Bag-of-words and how the model vocubulary is build up and potentially neglect vision labels it incounters during the media object prediction
-M2 is by far better. not primarely due to the slightly better performing accuracy scores of the model on unknown data, but rather due to the higher recall rate and therefore lower FN counts. M2 correctly classified 710 Instagram media objects with an accuracy of 0.776 which is (710-668) more than Instagram
- Best setup of M1 and M2 have similar amounts of features! (maybe critical element for good performance and generalization) [ 734 and 757 respectively]
