\chapter{Conclusions and Outlook} \label{conclusion_outlook}

    Conclusions of the main findings summarised
    This section should only contain information, which has been discussed earlier, no new information should be introduced
    Conclusions generally do not contain literature references
    It is possible to lay also an outlook based on the findings (new research questions and future directions, which would bring the topic further)

If there are many results, they can be discussed in a combined chapter “Results and Discussion”, where each result is immediately discussed. At the end, a comprehensive discussion needs to be written in a separate subchapter, which does not repeat the discussion elements.

Recommended tense: present (interpretation), other tenses if applicable.
