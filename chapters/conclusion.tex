\chapter{Conclusions} \label{conclusion_outlook}

In this thesis, two ML models named M1 and M2 were trained on Instagram media objects originating from the Canton of Zurich to predict NBRAs contained in Instagram and Flickr media objects from the Canton of Zug. Both models were tuned on the linearSVC and Random Forest fitting algorithms of which the former performed best. The creation and comparison of two models served the purpose to investigate the effect of combining text and image contained information on model performance compared to only using text-data for model training.\\
M2 which is trained on said data-combination proofed to perform better on new (unseen) data than M1. Not only did M2 have a slightly better overall precision but it also identified twice as many media objects that contained NBRAs. Therefore, by reducing the False Negative (FN) predictions M2 achieved to increase its recall compared to its predecessor M1. A comparison to recently created baseline-models of \parencite{Das2018, Li2018} revealed similar test accuracies of but rather at the lower end. These baseline-accuracies ranged from 89.91\% to 96.23\% whereas M1 and M2 achieved a test accuracy of 93.7\% and 88.2\% respectively (see figure \ref{tab:m1_linearSVC_bestscores} and figure \ref{tab:m2_linearSVC_bestscores}).\\
The visual matching of M2 predicted NBRA-occurrences to the ground truth data revealed plausible overlaps. This outcome supports the usage of social media data for similar tasks which could be an addition to or partly replace costly traditional methods. The ground truth additionally revealed interesting insights on the social media usage of 52 interviewees. Instagram and Facebook were as expected the dominant social media platforms. Flickr on the other hand was not mentioned once (see figure \ref{fig:interview_SMP}). The age distribution of social media users was estimated to be of similar proportions to sources such as \parencite{2013} with the same dominant age group of 21-30.

\section{Future prospects} \label{future_prospects}
The presented models in this thesis are far from their full potential. Small training datasets from inconsistent sources as well as further expendable data-processing show opportunities for method refinement. Instagram location accuracy could potentially be improved by utilising topographic keywords in the user-generated text to narrow down the media object origin similarly to \parencite{Ostermann2015}. \\
Additionally, different ML meta-algorithms should be investigated. One of which would be \textit{Ensemble Learning}. This approach combines multiple models with potentially different fitting algorithms to a single model \parencite{Zhou2009}. Another option would be \textit{Stacking} which is similar to \textit{Ensemble Learning} in the sense that multiple models are trained. Auxiliary a final model is trained based on the predictions of the individual models on the original training data. This approach has been shown to be extremely powerful and is currently used by Netflix to provide users with suitable movie suggestions \parencite{AndreasToscher2009}. The advantages of both approaches are increased prediction accuracies, reduced bias and less overfitting compared to individual models. \\
Furthermore, a more sophisticated VGI proxy potential could be estimated by conducting a statistical similarity analysis between the passive observation and the social media data inferred occurrences of recreational activities by using either Ripley's K Function or Moran's \textit{I} statistics in different radiuses around the three ground truth locations \parencite{OSullivan2003}.
