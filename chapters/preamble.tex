\chapter*{Summary}
 \addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Abstract}
Where do people perform Nature-Based Recreational Activities (NBRAs) and what factors draw them to specific areas? Recreation as a form of stress relief has become more important with increased rates of mental illnesses. This thesis fosters the information retrieval related to the recreational usage of space that may be used to support future planning. Thereby, georeferenced social media data of the social media platforms Instagram and Flickr is used to predict the occurrences of seven distinct recreation-classes in the research area located inside the Canton of Zug, Switzerland. 'Walking', 'hiking', 'jogging', 'biking', 'dog walking', 'horse riding' and 'picnicking' are the considered classes. \\
Machine Learning (ML) in combination with the deep-learning image recognition algorithm \textit{Google Cloud Vision} - that extracts labelled image elements - was used to train two text-classification models to identify the seven recreation-classes inside Instagram and Flickr media objects (posts). Many models of previous scientific studies either drew upon the text or image contained information but rarely were these two data-sources used in conjunction. One focal point of this thesis investigates the effect of training a model on a combination of text-data and image-data to potentially achieve an improved model performance. The linear Support Vector Classifier (linearSVC) and the decision tree based Random Forest fitting algorithm were tested. This approach functions as a complement to conventional data-acquisition methods such as surveys and interviews but with the benefits of potentially higher spatial and temporal resolutions as well as a cheaper implementation. Ground truth data in the form of passive observations of recreationists and 52 interviews was additionally acquired in three locations of the research area. This data was used on one hand to justify the legitimacy of the created models and on the other hand to acquire behavioural and demographic information about the social media presence of the interviewees. Finally, Foursquare data was used to evaluate the allocation efficiency of existing recreation related infrastructure compared to the peoples' usage of space derived from the social media data.\\
The results revealed a slightly higher performance for the linearSVC model trained on text as well as image-data with a manually verified average precision of 0.749 across all classes on unseen Instagram and Flickr data. The major improvement however lies in the achievement of twice as many correctly classified media objects containing NBRAs than the model that was solely trained on text-data. Therefore, a recall and generalisation increase were recorded. No significant precision difference was detected for predictions on media objects from different social media platforms.
The model outputs enabled the creation of maps which show the spatial distribution of the seven recreation-classes in the research area. \\

I would like to express my very great appreciation to all my supervisors, friends and institutions that helped me during the course of this thesis. First of all I want to thank ETH for providing me with the infrastructure, research literature and needed resources that allowed the start and completion of this thesis.\\
Personally I want to sincerely thank Dr. Marcel Hunziker for approving my master thesis proposal that originated from a term paper of the 'Advanced Landscape Research' lecture which he also supervised. \\
I would like to offer my special thanks to Dr. Flurina Wartmann from the WSL who was my primary contact throughout the entire thesis and who assisted me in setting up the ground truthing as well as in various administrative concerns. \\
Prof. Dr. Ross Purves and Dr. Rahul Deb Das from the geocomputation unit of the University of Zurich provided me with expert knowledge in all programming related issues for which I am deeply grateful.\\
\newline
Additionally, I would like to thank the spatial planing department of the Canton of Zug - especially Martina Brennecke and Alexander Gnos. Former for her personal assistance and insight on relevant projects in the research area and latter for his provision of needed geo-data in the form of shapefiles. My special thanks are extended to the staff of the company Zugerbergbahn, particularly to Christoph Sidler for providing me with passenger numbers of their mountain railway. \\
\newline
I cannot thank my sister Florence enough for conducting the entire 'passive observation' - an essential part of the ground truthing. This part would not have been possible without her. And finally I want to thank and mention my friends Achilleas Lehmann and Christopher O'Bryan who proofread my thesis and gave constructive feedback that lead to this final version of my thesis.

\section*{Definitions} \label{definitions}
% hspace*{1.6cm}  \= \kill
\texttt{API:} Application interfaces allow the controlled access of programs to specific services of a software system. 
\newline

\texttt{API endpoint:} Describes a specific service or communication channel a user can access to interact with an API. Different API endpoints provide the user with different data.
\newline

\texttt{Bulk upload:} In the context of this thesis, bulk uploads describe a certain amount of simultaneously or during a short period of time uploaded media objects to the same social media platform by a single author.
\newline

\texttt{Feature/word-token/token:} All these terms describe the features of a text-classification model and have identical meaning in the context of this thesis.
\newline

\texttt{Media object:} All user generated social media data that has been acquired through a API or third party company will be referred to as media objects. In the sense of machine learning the term media object can be used interchangeably with the term 'document'.
\newline

\texttt{Netlytic:} A third party company which provides licensed data of numerous social media platforms (among others Instagram) based on user specific queries.
\newline

\texttt{N-grams:} This parameter defines how word-tokens are interpreted by the model. Given a minimal and a maximal value the function is able to create new features by concatenating tokens that appear in succession.

\texttt{Pipelining:} Sequence of functions where the output of the preceding function is used as input for the successive function.

\texttt{Regular expression:} A sequence of characters that are used in programming to define string patterns are referred to as regular expressions or also 'regex'.
