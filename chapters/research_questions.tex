The proposed research questions evolve around the creation of a text-classification machine learning model to predict nature-based recreation activities in social media data as well as the model's explanatory power compared to conventional data-acquisition methods.

\section{RQ 1:}
Does a text-classification machine learning model trained on a combination of text and image-data yield better results than the same model solely trained on text-data?

\section{RQ 2:}
Can social media derived data function as a proxy to estimate the spacial occurrence of NBRAs as a complementary source to conventional methods such as interviews and surveys?
